# beanbotCrystalRewrite
WIP rewrite of beanbot using a Crystal backend

i was bored ok

### Running the bot

Clone this repo
Create a .env file in the project root and add `TOKEN=your bot token` and `CLIENT_ID=your bot client id` on individual lines
Make sure Crystal and Shards are installed and run these commands:
```
shards update
shards install
crystal run main.cr
```
If all goes well you should see `2 environment variables loaded!` and some info logs in your console, the bot is now running!

#### Current Commands
